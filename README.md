Work through Chapter 5 in the textbook. Actively watch all ten videos in this module one by one, in order, and code up as many sample programs from each video (you do not need to submit the code from these exercises, no one will see your code, but you will really help your Java skills if you use your human hands and your real keyboard (start building programming muscle memory). Commit to spending 30 concentrated minutes on each video and 

Read, study, and code up the examples from the following three (free) webpages:

Code up these three (or four if you are doing the extra credit assignment)  programs and submit your *.java source code to your remote repo in GitHub Classroom. Please use the java class file names as specified here. If you know how to zip files, you may also zip your root directory and submit your zipped files to your GitHub Classroom remote repo. 

1) package: mystudent; class files: App.java, Student.java - Re-watch the video "Classes and Objects" and code up everything in the video

2) package: mystuff; class files: Driver.java, MyStuff.java - This is the challenge at the end of "Classes and Objects." Your choice of what "object in everyday life" you want to use for this program. 

3) package: myanimals; class files: Animal.java, Cat.java, Dog.java - Re-watch the video "Static and the Cat Class" and code up everything to create two subclasses (Cat.java and Dog.java) from the Animal class. Note how the static variable numOfAnimals works in your program. Create an output statement that outputs the current number of animals objects you have whenever a new Dog or Cat object is created. This is how you will know your program is working properly.

4) Advanced (extra credit) - Code up the card game program at the end of Chapter 5 in our textbook.

Let me know in the "Text Entry" area of this assignment if you completed the extra credit assignment. If you did not do the extra credit, leave the "Text Entry" blank and do not submit anything - I will check your remote repo on GitHub Classroom to score your programming assignments for this module.
